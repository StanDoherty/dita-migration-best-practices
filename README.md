# DITA Migration Best Practices for Workgroups (DRAFT IN PROGRESS)
First pass at collecting best practices for small- to medium-sized teams migrating to OASIS DITA

So - your workgroup or division is considering a migration to DITA, but your management team has not made firm commitments to you about:

* Increased operating budget
* Increased staffing
* Relief from continuous release deadlines

You are tasked with developing a migration proposal in the absence of guarantees that these supporting commitments will be in place. How might *you* approach this task based upon the collective experience of other startups, workgroups, or divisions that have successfuly completed a migration?

In short -- be conservative, be realistic. In OASIS meetings, we often describe DITA simultaneously as "highly beneficial" and "highly disruptive." It's only human nature to focus on the former, all those tantalizing DITA mapping, metadata, processing, reuse, and conditionalization features. What tends to kill DITA migration projects are all the disruptions, all the change management and process re-engineering work that is rarely apparent when you are reading about DITA or doing a preliminary pilot project. The big companies with access to dedicated tool engineers, information architects, conversion budgets, and consultants can recover from mistakes in planning or execution; workgroups without a lot of support cannot.
