# DITA Migration Best Practices for Workgroups (DRAFT IN PROGRESS)
First pass at collecting best practices for small- to medium-sized teams migrating to OASIS DITA

So - your workgroup or division within a larger company is considering a migration to DITA, but your management team has not made firm commitments to about:

* Increased operating budget
* Increased staffing
* Relief from continuous release deadlines

You are tasked with developing a migration proposal in the absence of guarantees that these supporting commitments will be in place. How might *you* approach this task based upon teh collective experience of other startups, workgroups, or dvisions that have successfuly completed a migration?
